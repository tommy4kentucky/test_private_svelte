  "statement": "I work at the intersection of communication, emergency management, and community service. With over 17 years teaching university-level communication and public speaking, I've equipped future leaders to communicate under pressure. My practical experience includes supervising FEMA's Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program closeout at Kentucky Emergency Management (KYEM), supporting SEOC activations, field deployments with a world-class search and rescue team during federally declared disasters, and serving on public information teams for KYEM, FEMA, and SAR operations. Earlier nonprofit work as director of communications complements this foundation in strategic, audience-centered messaging, program oversight, and public service.",
